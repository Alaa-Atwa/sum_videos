# sum_videos
  - A tool to calculate the total time of a course ( or any  videos) you have locally on your machine.
  - helpful when studying and you want to know the time you need for this course. 
  
## Usage:
1. navigate to your course 's root directory.
2. copy the script to that direcotry, or add the script to  one of your "PATH" directories. 
3. run ./tcourse inside the directory of your course and it will look for every video you have recursively,
   if you added the script to $PATH then you can simply run "tcourse" inside any directory.
